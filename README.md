## What This Project Delivers

Career Path Generator is a **five-module AI pipeline** that takes any user profile and delivers:

- **Personalized Career Roadmaps** — A 3-year milestone-based transition plan grounded in real market data, not hallucinated advice.
- **RAG-Powered Recommendations** — Retrieves the most relevant career documents from a 500+ document knowledge base before generating any output. Every recommendation is grounded.
- **Life-Stage Awareness** — A new parent, a burned-out engineer, and a recent graduate get fundamentally different recommendations for the same target role. The system understands context.
- **Ethical AI Audit** — Every roadmap is evaluated against PASSIONIT (Purpose, Accountability, Safety, Sustainability, Inclusivity, Objectivity, Non-bias, Integrity, Transparency) and PRUTL (Privacy, Reliability, Usability, Trustworthiness, Legality) frameworks.
- **Bias Detection** — The system flags if recommendations are influenced by institution tier, geography, or gender — and explains why.
- **India-Calibrated Data** — Salary benchmarks in LPA, city-level demand scores, GCC-specific paths, and Indian market trends throughout.

## Project Modules

### Module 1 — User Profile Engine

**What it does:**
Collects and structures the user's complete profile — skills, experience, life stage, burnout level, career goals, and personal context. Computes derived scores used downstream.

**Key profile fields:**
- `technical_skills` / `soft_skills` / `certifications` — skill inventory
- `life_stage` — Early Career / Mid Career / Career Break / Re-entering
- `burnout_level` (1–10) — adjusts recommended transition difficulty
- `recent_life_event` — New Parent / Layoff / Health Issue / Relocation
- `institution_tier` — Tier 1 / 2 / 3 — flagged in bias audit
- `leadership_score` — computed from experience + certifications + role seniority

**Why it matters:**
The profile is the query. Everything downstream — retrieval, generation, audit — is personalized based on what this module captures. A shallow profile produces a generic roadmap. A rich profile produces a precise one.

**Output:** Structured JSON profile stored in Supabase, passed to RAG pipeline on roadmap generation request.

---

### Module 2 — RAG Pipeline

**What it does:**
Converts the user profile into a vector embedding, searches the knowledge base for the most relevant career documents, and returns the top-5 context chunks to the LLM.

**How retrieval works:**
- User profile → `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (sentence-transformers) → 384-dimension vector
- Vector query → ChromaDB similarity search → top-5 relevant career docs retrieved
- Metadata filtering by `domain` and `doc_type` before ranking — prevents cross-domain noise
- Retrieved docs passed as grounded context to Groq LLaMA 3

**Knowledge base document types:**

| Type | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `role_description` | ~150 | Day-to-day responsibilities, success metrics |
| `transition_path` | ~100 | Step-by-step career change guides |
| `skill_requirements` | ~100 | Technical + soft skills per role |
| `salary_data` | ~50 | LPA benchmarks by role, city, experience |
| `industry_trend` | ~50 | Market demand, growth projections |
| `career_story` | ~50 | Real anonymized transition narratives |

**Why it matters:**
Without RAG, the LLM hallucinates salary figures and invents transition timelines. With RAG, every roadmap is grounded in actual career data. This is what makes the system industry-grade.

**Output:** Top-5 retrieved document chunks with metadata, ready for LLM injection.

---

### Module 3 — LLM Roadmap Generator

**What it does:**
Takes the user profile + retrieved RAG context and generates a structured 3-year career transition roadmap with milestone nodes, skill gaps, salary projections, and emotional adjustment forecast.

**Output structure:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `current_role` | Starting node |
| `target_role` | Final destination node |
| `transition_path` | Array of milestone objects with timeline, skills, salary |
| `success_probability` | Float 0–100 |
| `skill_gap` | What the user needs to acquire |
| `emotional_adjustment_forecast` | Stress curve over transition timeline |
| `alternative_paths` | 1–2 alternate route options |
| `explanation` | LLM reasoning for this specific path |

**Why it matters:**
This is the user-facing output. The React Flow roadmap visualizer parses this JSON into an interactive node graph. The quality of this output determines the product's value.

**Output:** Structured JSON roadmap stored in Supabase, cached in Redis, rendered in React Flow on the frontend.

---

### Module 4 — Ethical Audit

**What it does:**
Sends the generated roadmap back to Groq with a specialized audit prompt that evaluates the recommendation against PASSIONIT and PRUTL ethical frameworks.

**PASSIONIT dimensions:**
`Purpose` · `Accountability` · `Safety` · `Sustainability` · `Inclusivity` · `Objectivity` · `Non-bias` · `Integrity` · `Transparency`

**PRUTL dimensions:**
`Privacy` · `Reliability` · `Usability` · `Trustworthiness` · `Legality`

**Audit output per dimension:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `dimension` | PASSIONIT / PRUTL dimension name |
| `score` | Integer 1–10 |
| `risk_level` | Low / Medium / High |
| `explanation` | Why this score |
| `recommendation` | What to improve |
| `flagged_biases` | e.g. "Tier-1 institution over-weighted" |

**Why it matters:**
Most career recommendation systems are black boxes. The ethical audit makes this system explainable and trustworthy — users can see exactly why a recommendation was made and whether it is biased. This is the project's strongest differentiator.

**Output:** Audit scores table rendered in the Reports tab. Bias flags shown prominently.

---

### Module 5 — Data Pipeline

**What it does:**
Builds and maintains the knowledge base that powers the RAG system. Sources career data from multiple origins, cleans and normalizes it into a unified format, and ingests it into ChromaDB as vector embeddings.

**Data sources:**

| Source | Data Type | Volume |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| O\*NET API | Career descriptions, skill requirements | 30+ occupations |
| BLS API | Growth trends, demand scores | All 25 clusters |
| Kaggle Datasets | Career transition paths, job skills | 200+ records |
| Crawl4AI (Naukri/LinkedIn) | Live job listings | 1000+ listings |
| Manual Curation | Transition stories, India-specific context | 90+ documents |

**Document JSON format:**
```json
{
  "text": "Full career content — 200 to 400 words",
  "metadata": {
    "doc_id": "doc_001",
    "source": "Manual | O*NET | BLS | Naukri | LinkedIn | Kaggle",
    "domain": "AI & ML | Cybersecurity | EdTech | Product Management | ...",
    "doc_type": "role_description | transition_path | skill_requirements | salary_data | industry_trend | career_story",
    "role_title": "Machine Learning Engineer",
    "experience_level": "Entry | Mid | Senior | Leadership",
    "region": "India | Bangalore | Mumbai | Global",
    "last_scraped": "2026-03-08"
  }
}
```

**Why it matters:**
The RAG pipeline is only as good as the knowledge base. Without accurate, well-tagged career documents, retrieval returns irrelevant results and the LLM generates generic advice. This module is the foundation of everything.

**Output:** 500+ embedded documents in ChromaDB, 25 career clusters in Supabase, 1000 synthetic user profiles for testing.

Module 1: Profile Engine → structured profile JSON
         ↓
Check Redis Cache → if hit, return cached roadmap instantly
         ↓ (cache miss)
Module 2: RAG Pipeline

  → ChromaDB retrieves top-5 relevant career docs
         ↓
Module 3: LLM Generator
  → Groq LLaMA 3 receives profile + retrieved docs
  → generates structured roadmap JSON
         ↓
Module 4: Ethical Audit
  → second Groq call with PASSIONIT/PRUTL prompt

         ↓
Store in Supabase → cache in Redis
         ↓
Frontend renders:
  React Flow  →  interactive roadmap visualizer
  Recharts    →  skill gap radar + demand scores
  Reports tab →  ethical audit table
```
